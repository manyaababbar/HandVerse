# HandVerse
Problem Statement :Our project is focused on developing a web-based hand gesture
recognition system for video control applications. It allows users to interact with video
content through intuitive real time gestures for playback actions like play, pause,
fast-forward, all via a browser extension. Its goal is to enhance user interaction, providing a
hands-free and accessible experience while ensuring accuracy and responsiveness

Objectives : Provide an accessible, hands-free interface for users, improving the multimedia
experience by creating a web-based hand gesture recognition system to control video
applications using simple hand movements.


Methodology : Developed a gesture recognition system using deep learning and computer
vision. It utilizes OpenCV for video capture and preprocessing and MediaPipe for hand
landmark detection. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on a diverse dataset
of hand gesture images, incorporating data augmentation techniques to improve
generalization. The system is implemented using a Flask-based API for real-time gesture
classification, which communicates with a Google Chrome extension to execute video
playback commands.
